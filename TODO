This is a list of some of the things I plan to work on for future releases
of cchess. If there is something you feel should be included in a future
version of cchess, please email me about it.

1. Add time register.

2. Add .rc file to save options.

3. Save and load the game.

4. When disconnected, reconnnect would continue the game.

*5. Add a AI modules, so can play with computer. It's too hard, I am not sure.
